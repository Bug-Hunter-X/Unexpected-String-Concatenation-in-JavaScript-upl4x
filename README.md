This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving unexpected string concatenation due to loose typing. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with type checking to prevent the issue.  The bug arises from the implicit type coercion in JavaScript when adding a number and a string.  This is a subtle error that can be difficult to debug without careful attention to data types.
